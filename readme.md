## This website is about a fictional resort named Jim Bob'b Hillbilly Resort. It has basic html and basic css styles. Mainly this project was made to practice some of the said html andd css I have learned so far, but also it was created to practice branching a project, applying different styles to branches other than the master, and then merge the one I like the best with the master.

## no setup requirements just load the website

## no known bugs

## the only technologies used were git and github
